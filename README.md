Scripts
=======

Some scripts i use on different systems

## Install Linux
You have to use this command :
```bash
export PATH=~/path/to/git/repository/bin:$PATH
```

If you want a permanent way to have this repository to your path, add the command above to ~/.bashrc if this file exists and to ~/.profile otherwise.

## Install Windows
